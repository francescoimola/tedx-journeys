# Program of Talks for 2021 [TEDx University of Greenwich](https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/41516)

This event, titled Journeys, is being produced through an innovative virtual production technology inside a physical theatre space. Attendees will be part of this journey and they will witness virtual environments in real time.

Respecting this age old tradition of telling stories and sharing knowledge we are attempting to add value through this addition. Our hope is to create an immersive space that allows us to accept our vulnerability and enhance human connection.

The journey of a single individual is journey of humanity and an answer to the question of life. So with that we bring you journeys taken by our torchbearers.
